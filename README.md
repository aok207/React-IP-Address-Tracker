## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process
I first did the top part: the input field first. And then I did the map. And then I did the middle part where the informations were shown. And lastly I made it responsive. 

### Built with

- tailwind css
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was suprisingly challenging. And I learnt new things as well. Now I know how to add maps to my react apps. I now have a better understanding of react hooks, specifically useEffect. I can now make API requests comfortably. Pretty dope project overall.

### Continued development

Still need to learn more about other react hooks. And I think it's time to learn typescript.

### Useful resources

- [ipify](https://www.ipify.org) - I used this website to get the ip address of the user. It's pretty simple and I think I'll use this every times I need to get the ip address.
- [useEffect Hook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJgIjIuY7U&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h&index=2&pp=iAQB) - This video finally made me understand how useEffect hook works. Pretty good video. I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn about useEffect.
